## Reproducibility Submission for MEMPHIS

**Paper name:** MEMPHIS: Holistic Lineage-based Reuse and 
Memory Management for Multi- backend ML Systems

Source Code Info
 - Repository: Apache SystemDS [1] (https://github.com/apache/systemds).
 - Programming Language: Java, Python, R, SystemDS DML (a R-like Domain Specific Language)
 - Additional Programming Language info: Java version 11 is required

Hardware Info to Reproduce Experiment Results

 - Processor: AMD EPYC 744P CPU @ 2.80GHz or above
 - Cores: 24 physical cores (48 vCores)
 - Memory: 38GP driver, 230GB executors, 20GB bufferpool, 7GB operation memory, 5GB lineage cache
 - Disk: SSD, at least 60GB. More is better.

Experimentation Info

 - Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is used for the experiments. However, Apache SystemDS and the experiments are fully portable to any OS. CUDA 10.2, CUDNN 7.6.
-----------------------------------

### Step-by-step Execution

**Step 1:** System setup.

Install jdk11, maven, python3, cuda10.2 cudnn7.6 PyTorch2.1. Java 11 and Maven are needed to build the source code. Python is required to execute the baselines. We use R to generate the plots.

**Step 2:** Clone and build the source code.

Clone Apache SystemDS. Next, follow the [documentation](https://systemds.apache.org/docs/3.0.0/site/install) to build SystemDS from source.

**Step 3:** Download and prepare the datasets.

All the datasets are publicly available. `datasets/` directory contains the scripts to prepare the datasets.

**Step 4:** Run micro benchmarks.

Execute the shell scripts in the `microbenchmarks/` directory.

**Step 5:** Run End-to-End ML pipelines and compare with other reuse frameworks.

Execute the shell scripts in the `MLPipelines` directory.

**Step 6:** Run other ML systems (PyTorch) for comparison.

Execute the PyTorch scripts in the `MLSystemsComparison` directory.
